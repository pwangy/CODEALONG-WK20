Authentication - Van

When building our API for logins, we should consider the following 2 things.
  authorization - not necessarily required, but needed to specify levels of access a user has
  authentication - allows your users to know who they are and post as themselves in your app



Token Authentication
Whiteboard:

        API  -----> SAVE USER
      |     ^
      |     |
  TOKEN     |
      |     REGISTER: USERNAME, PASSWORD
      v     ^
        USER


  during REGISTRATION our API endpoint needs to be able to take a user with their
    username
    password
  and SAVE these details to our DB

  before saving to db, we also need to:
    check that username is unique (not already in use)
    validate both username and password 
    encript password


  once the above has been done,
  the api returns a token to the user. 
  a token serves to:
    identitify user in future requests
    automatically authenticates them
  user will have to save the token for later use

see code.
